# Non-Relational Data Concepts

- When data is coming from multiple sources viz. mobile phone, social n/w etc. then relational database is not a good fit as its schema may not be compatible with incoming data and also cost will be very high for large volume of data. 

- in that case data is first input to staging later which can hold large volume of non-relational data
- this data is normally unstructured like audio, video files etc. 
- **Azure files or Blob Storage is used for such type of data repository**
- few good use cases for no non-relational data are IOT and telematics, gaming, web and mobile, and social network applications.
- Also we have semi-structured data which contains fields ( not same as relational db) and it can be stored in Azure files for further pricessing
- **The main non-relational file formats are JSON, which is probably the most popular and it's quickly replaced the XML as the de facto standard for non-relational data.**
- Another quite popular one is **Parquet** which uses a columnar format. Parquet was developed by **Cloudera and Twitter** and it's sufficient levels of compression and encoding make an excellent format for data ingestion.
- Another common columnar format is **ORC which stands for Optimized Row Columnar format**. It was **developed by Hortonworks** for optimizing read and write operations on a Apache Hive
- **Avro**, which uses a row based format. Also created by **Apache**.
