# Data Analytics

- data analysis is the process of inspecting, cleansing, transforming and modeling data with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, in supporting decision-making.
- examples: getting recomendatation on websites for which product to buy, which movie to watch, whether stock prices will go up or down etc. 

- 5 types:
### descriptive Analysis

- focuses on discovering what happened in the past based on historical data
- helps summarize large data into meaningful outcomes
- example: total sales last year
- 

### diagnostic analytics
- focuses on why it happened
- example: you could identify that a substantial amount of your customers left you in the month that your competitor launched a new product

### predictive analytics
- goal to discover what will happen
- example: what will be the Microsoft stock price by the end of next year?, will this customer default on his loan?


### prescriptive analytics
- what you should do next
-  while predictive analytics might tell you that an equipment component is likely to fail, if it gets above a certain temperature prescriptive analytics could recommend you to slow down the machine, to prevent the failure from happening.This could give enough time for a maintenance team to arrive and replace the component before it breaks


### cognitive analytics
- attempts to draw inferences for an existing data and patterns
- its a realm of artificial intelligence and it can do things such as transcribing audio to text or vice versa, find your objects and images, detect your anomalies in using natural language processing and LP, to understand and translate language and much more. Microsoft has an entire set of APIs related to this called Cognitive services.
