### Structured Data
- tabular data represented by columns and tables in relational database
- examples: SQL Server, Oracle DB2, MySQL etc.
- we have upfront info on structure of data called schema


### Semi-Structured Data

- its not classified based on rigid schema structure of relational database but it still holds some structure to it. 
- examples: XMl(Extensible Markup Language), JSON(JavaScript Object Notation), key-value pairs, graphs etc.
