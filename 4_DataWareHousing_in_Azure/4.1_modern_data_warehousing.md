# modern data warehousing(MDW)

- data warehouses are no longer just reorganizing the data from your OLTP systems into a more read intensive format. Instead, data houses nowadays will gather data from multiple data stores, including IOT, social networks, web APIs, files and multiple corporate systems such as your CRM, HR application, and ERP systems.

- **Advantages**:
  - cross referencing this data instead of keeping those in silos

- modern data warehouses must be able to read the data in various formats
  - XML, Parquet, ORC, JSON and much, much more
- can even use cognitive services to extract tax from a recorded phone call or obtain metadata from pictures that your company has.
- modern data warehouse solutions should be able to handle big data 
  - **phases of MDW:**
    - **data ingestion**
      - capturing the data from diff sources
      - **Solutions from Azure: Azure Data Factory, Stream Analytics or Event Hubs.**
    - **data staging**
      - holds the data temporarily
      - ELT operations keep the data on the staging layer and have the analytical system just grab the data on the fly for further analysis
      - **Azure Data Lake** can be used if we want to keep data in raw format
    - **data transformation:**
      - transform and process this data and model that into a format that is more convenient for the reporting
      - includes data cleansing, filtering, normalization or denormalization, conversational formats and so on.
