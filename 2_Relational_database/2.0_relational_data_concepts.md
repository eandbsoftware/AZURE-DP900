# Relational Data Concepts:

- Everything is **hosted in tables**.
- most important and widespread methods for storing and retrieving data
- **provides a simple and well-understood model for holding data**
- We use Relational Database when we need strong consistency for data
- example of applications: banking applications, e-commerce and online retail systems, and flight and hotel reservation sites


## Understanding Relational Database

- Everything is stored in Tables
- A table is just a database object that **holds data in a row and column format.**
- Each table must have a column or a combination of columns, that uniquely identifies each row in that table. This is called a primary key. No two rows can have the same primary key
- As you commonly have several tables in your database, you generally use primary and foreign key string for the relationship between these tables
- A foreign key is just a reference to a primary key on a related table.
- cardinality of the relationship:
  - one-to-one
  - one-to-many
  - many-to-many
- Views:
  - view is just a virtual table based on the results of a query that allows you to filter the data
  
- **Index**:
  - index help you search data substantially faster
  - occupy extra space on the databases and 
  - each index should be maintained by the database server
  - two types:
    - **clustered index**:
      - which physically organizes the data on your table, based on a column or key that you choose
      - most important index on the table
      - we can have only one clustered index
    - **nonclustered index**:
      - less efficient than clustered ones
      - we can have as many as required
  - The overall rule is create a clustered index based on your most searched column, and one or more nonclustered indices for columns that are also searched relatively often.
- **stored procedures and functions**:
  - implement repeatable portion of code
  - can even accept input and output parameters, making them quite flexible
